# Primality Testing Algorithms 

In this program you will find an implementation of a deterministic algorithm as well as a probabilistic algorithm. 
These appraoches are as discussed in the text *Algorithms* by Dasgupta.  

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.
