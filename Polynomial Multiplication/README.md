# Polynomial Multiplication Algorithms

Polynomial Multiplication using a naive method and using Karatsuba's Algorithm. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine. 

### Prerequisites

What you'll need to get this program running

```
* Make sure all required files have cloned correctly
* C++ Compiler
```

### Run It! 

Series of examples on running this program 

```
####### First compile & create an executable by running
    > make 

// You will now have an exec file named 'main'
Usage:
    ./make user-input
// User input: Enter a value for the nth degree polynomials you wish to multiply 

    > ./make 10
        Results match.
    
        Timing: 
        Naive algorithm: 7e-06 seconds
        Karatsuba algorithm: 0.000435 seconds
        Naive algorithm wins!
    
```
