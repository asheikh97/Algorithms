# Polynomial Multiplication Algorithms

Polynomial Multiplication using a naive method and using Karatsuba's Algorithm. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine. 

### Prerequisites

What you'll need to get this program running

```
* Make sure all required files have cloned correctly
* C++ Compiler
```

### Run It! 

Series of examples on running this program 

```
// Create an executable
> make 

Usage: ./main user-input

// User input: Enter a value for the nth degree polynomials you wish to multiply 

> ./main 10
    Results match.
    
    Timing: 
    Naive algorithm: 7e-06 seconds
    Karatsuba algorithm: 0.000435 seconds
    Naive algorithm wins!
