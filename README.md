# Algorithms

**My implementation of various algorithms discussed in the text *Aglorithms by S. Dasgupta*.**

## What you can exepect 
All code for the follwoing algorithms been written in C++
```
> Matrix Multiplication - Using a dynamic algorithm approach 
> Polynomial Multiplication - Compares a naive method & Karatsuba's Multiplication Algorithm
> Primality Test - Compares a deterministic & probabilistic method
> Topological Sorting of DAG's - 

```
