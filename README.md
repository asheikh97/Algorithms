# Algorithms

###### My implementation of various algorithms discussed in the text *Aglorithms by S. Dasgupta*.

## What you can expect ðŸ¤”

All code for the follwoing algorithms has been written in C++
```
> Matrix Multiplication 
  - Using a dynamic algorithm approach 
> Polynomial Multiplication 
  - Compares a naive method & Karatsuba's Multiplication Algorithm
> Primality Test 
  - Compares a deterministic & probabilistic method
> Topological Sorting
  - Sorting of directed acyclic graphs
